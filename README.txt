Old ongoing projet in C++ and Qt design to teach mental calculation with ramping difficulties and game mechanics to make it fun (score, time and difficulty modifiers, life, currency?, bonus ...) for my kids, and keep on improving it to teach multiple level of math for all ages

TO DO LIST:
verify window functionnality
actually code the math part
add a scrolling function for the math formula + playtest with other
add gaming feature and failing mechanics
cycle of playtest + adding / twiking game mechanics and difficulty level (always remember, if you find it easy after playtesting for several hours, other wont)
=> have fun, keep the kids in the developpement process if old enough (hopefully)
